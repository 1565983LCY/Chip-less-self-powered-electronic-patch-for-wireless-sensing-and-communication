# Chip-less, self-powered electronic patch for wireless sensing and communication
An integrated software based on LabVIEW was developed, which enables wireless signal reception, oscilloscope trigger control, as well as displacement detection, direction discrimination and data encoding.

1. LabVIEW software (version 2018 or higher) must be installed.  
2. The oscilloscope is connected to a computer via serial port or network. In this study, a RIGOL MSO8000 series oscilloscope was connected to a laptop, with necessary drivers configured. Relevant driver files and sub-VI programs are included in the "RIGOL DS5000/7000/8000 Series" package.  
3. Upon the antenna-equipped oscilloscope detecting an electromagnetic signal and triggering, a customized LabVIEW program processes the signal according to predefined algorithm, yielding experimental outputs.  
4. The custom program supports continuous triggering, enabling real-time data acquisition and storage by the oscilloscope. Further informations are available from the authors upon reasonable request for research purposes.
